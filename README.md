# CS105 – Development Principles 2

This repository contains my work for the course **CS105: Development Principles 2** at Yoobee College.

## 🧠 Course Overview

**CS105** is an object-oriented programming (OOP)-focused course using C++.  
It emphasizes practical understanding of how to build modular, maintainable software using real-world programming concepts.

Key learning areas include:
- 🧱 Class design and object-oriented thinking
- 🔒 Encapsulation (private/public access)
- 🧬 Inheritance and polymorphism
- 🧪 Structuring and testing reusable code
- 🗂️ Applying OOP to small projects like games or data processing tools
